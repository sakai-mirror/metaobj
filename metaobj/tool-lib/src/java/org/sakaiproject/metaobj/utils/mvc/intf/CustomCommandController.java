/**
 * Use this controller when you need to override the way the backing object is created.
 * If all you are doing is return new MyBackingObject() you won't need to implement this,
 * Spring will handle that for you.  Do not use this method to populate helping data
 * into the model.  This method does not get called if there is an error in validation.
 * If you rely on this information for putting stuff in the request, you will not have
 * it there in the case of validation error.  If you need to put helping data in the model,
 * implement FormController's referenceData method.
